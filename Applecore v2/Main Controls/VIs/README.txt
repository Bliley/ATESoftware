MAIN CONTROLS

The LabVIEW code serves as a comprehensive control system for managing various aspects of a testing 
environment. Designed with flexibility and efficiency in mind, it empowers users to effortlessly add 
or remove positions from any rack across different systems.

The code seamlessly integrates functionalities for transferring board information between aging tests 
and FVT/OSC tests, ensuring a smooth transition and maintaining data integrity throughout the testing 
process.

With a user-friendly interface, the code enables users to effortlessly visualize the active positions 
for any specified system, providing a quick overview of the testing status across multiple racks.

Additionally, the code empowers users to access and analyze aging curvefit data for all positions on a 
specified rack, offering valuable insights into the performance and characteristics of the tested components.

Furthermore, the code allows users to examine the change in parts per million (Ppm) of frequency over a 
range of temperatures for each position on a selected rack. This feature facilitates in-depth analysis 
and evaluation of the components' behavior under different thermal conditions.

With its intuitive controls and comprehensive features, the LabVIEW code serves as a powerful tool for 
managing positions, transferring board information, monitoring active positions, analyzing aging curvefit, 
and investigating frequency changes. It streamlines testing operations, enhances data analysis capabilities, 
and enables users to make informed decisions based on the collected data, contributing to the overall 
efficiency and effectiveness of the testing environment.
